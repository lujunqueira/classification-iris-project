# Iris Flower Classification

This project uses classic machine learning classifiers to identify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements from the well-known Iris dataset (scikit-learn built-in). It compares the performance of four supervised algorithms.

### Objective

To train and evaluate models that classify iris flowers into three species—*setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*—based on flower measurements.

### Algorithms Used

- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

### Workflow

- Load and inspect the dataset
- Split data into training and test sets
- Apply feature scaling when needed
- Train each model
- Generate predictions and evaluation metrics
- Visualize results with confusion matrices

### Evaluation Metrics

- Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)
- Accuracy
- Confusion matrix (via heatmap)
